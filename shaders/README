Generate the GLSL shaders from the spirv shaders by running

generate_shaders_gl.pl

(Make sure qsb and spirv commands are in your path. E.g:
export PATH=$PATH:~/VulkanSDK/1.3.283.0/macOS/bin:~/Qt/6.7.2/macos/bin
)

Since Qt 6.6 we should be able to access this programmetically with QShader, but for now I do it manually
