the contents of the .gl files are taken from the qsb dump of the spirv shaders,
section GLSL 150 [Standard]

qsb -dump ./shaders/.qsb/endoftrack.vert.qsb
qsb -dump ./shaders/.qsb/endoftrack.frag.qsb

Since Qt 6.6 we should be able to access this programmetically with QShader, but for now I do it manually
